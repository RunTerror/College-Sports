## Technical Details

Firebase is used as the backend, providing secure and scalable solutions for user authentication, real-time database management with Firestore, and cloud storage for media assets.

- Firebase Authentication ensures that only users with valid "@ietlucknow.ac.in" email IDs can access the application.
- Firestore, the real-time NoSQL database provided by Firebase, is used to store and manage data related to announcements, complaints, group chats, achievements, and user profiles.
- Cloud Storage is utilized for storing media files associated with achievements or group chat messages.
